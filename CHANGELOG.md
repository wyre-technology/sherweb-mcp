## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Interactive subscription card via MCP Apps (SEP-1865).** `sherweb_subscriptions_get` results now render as an interactive card in MCP Apps hosts (Claude Desktop/web, and other hosts advertising the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension) instead of a wall of JSON. The card shows the product, customer, status, quantity, billing cycle, commitment/renewal dates, and fees as human-readable labels. The card is read-only — subscription changes affect billing, so no write action is exposed from the card. Non-App hosts are unaffected: the tool's JSON payload is unchanged apart from a new `_card` field.
  - The renderable tool advertises the UI via `_meta` (`ui/resourceUri`, plus the nested `ui.resourceUri` form) pointing at a new `ui://sherweb/subscription-card.html` resource served as `text/html;profile=mcp-app`. The card HTML is a self-contained vite single-file bundle embedded at build time (`src/generated/subscription-card-html.ts`, committed), so plain `npm run build` and CI never need vite. The server now declares the `resources` capability and answers `resources/list` / `resources/read` (`src/resources.ts`).
  - The card is neutral by default (system fonts, no vendor identity, no external fetches) and brandable via `window.__BRAND__` injection or `MCP_BRAND_*` env vars (`MCP_BRAND_NAME`, `MCP_BRAND_LOGO_URL`, `MCP_BRAND_PRIMARY_COLOR`, `MCP_BRAND_ACCENT_COLOR`, `MCP_BRAND_BG`, `MCP_BRAND_TEXT`): at serve time the server replaces the card's BRAND_INJECT marker with an inline, `<`-escaped `window.__BRAND__` script, so self-hosters can theme the card without rebuilding. No brand configured = HTML served byte-identical.
  - The card payload builder is best-effort: the customer-name lookup (via the existing `/customers/{id}` endpoint) degrades gracefully and any card failure drops the card without affecting the tool result. New contract tests in `src/mcp-apps.test.ts` pin the `_meta` advertisement, the `ui://` resource wire shape, the neutral-default/brand-injection behavior, and the card normalization.

### Fixed
- Multi-client Streamable HTTP: build a fresh `Server` + fresh
  `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per `/mcp` request (stateless —
  `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`) instead of sharing one stateful transport
  for the process lifetime. The shared, stateful transport
  (`sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID()`) rejected every client after the
  first with `-32600 "Invalid Request: Server already initialized"`, so behind
  the multi-user gateway only the first user since container start received
  tools — everyone else silently got zero tools until a restart. Request
  handlers were extracted into a `setupHandlers(server)` / `createFreshServer()`
  factory so both stdio and per-request HTTP servers share one definition. Each
  per-request server + transport is disposed on `res` close. stdio mode keeps a
  single long-lived server (it is inherently single-client). The gateway
  credential-header check and per-request `runWithCredentials`
  (AsyncLocalStorage) isolation are preserved. The per-request handler is fully
  guarded: on error it responds
  `500 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32603,...},"id":null}` when the
  response has not started and never rethrows, so one bad request cannot crash
  the container via a global `unhandledRejection` handler.
- `GET /health` (and new `GET /healthz`) are now shallow, unauthenticated
  liveness probes that always return `200 {"status":"ok"}`. Previously
  `/health` called `getCredentials()` and returned `503` when no
  process-wide credentials were set, which is always the case in gateway
  mode (`AUTH_MODE=gateway`) where credentials arrive per-request via
  headers. This caused the Azure Container Apps liveness probe to fail and
  SIGTERM-kill the container in a crash loop.
- CI `Test` job: added the missing `.eslintrc.json` so `npm run lint` can
  resolve a config (the reusable `mcp-server-ci.yml` workflow runs lint), and
  resolved the pre-existing `prefer-const` violations it surfaced.

### Added
- `src/health.ts` liveness-probe helpers (`isHealthPath`, `HEALTH_RESPONSE`)
  with unit tests in `src/health.test.ts`, giving the `Test` job a passing
  `vitest run` and covering the new `/health` / `/healthz` behavior.
