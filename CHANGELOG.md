## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Fixed a deterministic cross-tenant OAuth token cache leak in gateway mode.** `authenticate()` in `src/utils/client.ts` cached the Sherweb `accessToken`/`tokenExpiry` in module-level `let` variables shared by every request. Because Sherweb tokens are valid for ~59 minutes, this was not a rare race — it was a guaranteed cross-tenant credential reuse under normal multi-tenant traffic: any tenant whose request landed within another tenant's still-valid token window would deterministically receive that prior tenant's bearer token, regardless of which tenant's credentials it presented. Confirmed as a live exposure in the `conduit-prod` deployment. Fixed by replacing the module-level cache with a `Map` keyed by tenant identity (`clientId` + `subscriptionKey`, the same fields that already distinguish tenants when resolving raw credentials via the existing per-request `AsyncLocalStorage` credential store), so each tenant only ever reads back its own token while still allowing legitimate token reuse across concurrent requests for the *same* tenant. A 401 response now evicts only the failing tenant's cache entry, never another tenant's. The previously-dead, never-called `resetClient()` export (a half-built, non-tenant-aware reset mechanism) was removed rather than wired in — a global reset doesn't fit a tenant-keyed cache and would itself have been a footgun (wiping every tenant's valid token on any one tenant's auth failure). Added regression tests in `src/utils/client.test.ts`: a sequential test reproducing the bug's real-world trigger (tenant B authenticates within tenant A's still-valid window, tenant A's next call must still use its own token) and a forced-interleave test using manually-resolved deferred promises to overlap two tenants' OAuth flows and assert on actual token values, not object identity.

### Added
- `sherweb_subscriptions_amendment_status`: polls `GET /tracking/{trackingId}` for the outcome of a submitted quantity amendment (`Unknown`, `Queued`, `Processing`, `Success`, `Failure`). Sherweb's `amendments/{id}/status` endpoint is deprecated in favour of `TrackRequest`, so this uses the latter.
- **Interactive subscription card via MCP Apps (SEP-1865).** `sherweb_subscriptions_get` results now render as an interactive card in MCP Apps hosts (Claude Desktop/web, and other hosts advertising the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension) instead of a wall of JSON. The card shows the product, customer, status, quantity, billing cycle, commitment/renewal dates, and fees as human-readable labels. The card is read-only — subscription changes affect billing, so no write action is exposed from the card. Non-App hosts are unaffected: the tool's JSON payload is unchanged apart from a new `_card` field.
  - The renderable tool advertises the UI via `_meta` (`ui/resourceUri`, plus the nested `ui.resourceUri` form) pointing at a new `ui://sherweb/subscription-card.html` resource served as `text/html;profile=mcp-app`. The card HTML is a self-contained vite single-file bundle embedded at build time (`src/generated/subscription-card-html.ts`, committed), so plain `npm run build` and CI never need vite. The server now declares the `resources` capability and answers `resources/list` / `resources/read` (`src/resources.ts`).
  - The card is neutral by default (system fonts, no vendor identity, no external fetches) and brandable via `window.__BRAND__` injection or `MCP_BRAND_*` env vars (`MCP_BRAND_NAME`, `MCP_BRAND_LOGO_URL`, `MCP_BRAND_PRIMARY_COLOR`, `MCP_BRAND_ACCENT_COLOR`, `MCP_BRAND_BG`, `MCP_BRAND_TEXT`): at serve time the server replaces the card's BRAND_INJECT marker with an inline, `<`-escaped `window.__BRAND__` script, so self-hosters can theme the card without rebuilding. No brand configured = HTML served byte-identical.
  - The card payload builder is best-effort: the customer-name lookup (via the existing `/customers/{id}` endpoint) degrades gracefully and any card failure drops the card without affecting the tool result. New contract tests in `src/mcp-apps.test.ts` pin the `_meta` advertisement, the `ui://` resource wire shape, the neutral-default/brand-injection behavior, and the card normalization.

### Fixed
- **Every tool but one called a Sherweb endpoint that does not exist.** Eight of the nine API-backed tools used REST-shaped paths that were never in Sherweb's API (`/customers/{id}/subscriptions/{subId}`, `/payable-charges/{chargeId}`, `/catalog/products`), so every call returned 404 while `tools/list` looked perfectly healthy — the server advertised a full toolset and then failed on use. Sherweb's API is operation-shaped, not resource-nested: subscriptions and receivable charges live under `/billing/` with the customer passed as a `customerId` *query* parameter. All paths are now transcribed from the vendor's published definitions (`Sherweb.Apis.Distributor.OpenAPI.json` and the Distributor Postman collection in [sherweb/Public-Apis](https://github.com/sherweb/Public-Apis), plus the OpenAPI definitions behind each operation on [developers.sherweb.com/reference](https://developers.sherweb.com/reference/)), and pinned by URL-asserting contract tests in `src/domains/endpoints.test.ts`:
  - `sherweb_billing_payable_charges`: `/payable-charges` → `/billing/payable-charges`. Its `billingCycleType`, `periodFrom` and `periodTo` parameters were removed — those are fields on the *response* `Charge` schema, not query inputs. `page`/`pageSize` were removed too; no Sherweb endpoint paginates. The one documented parameter, `date` (any day inside the desired billing period), is now supported.
  - `sherweb_billing_charge_details`: the Distributor API publishes exactly one operation and has no per-charge endpoint, so this now reads the billing period and selects the matching `chargeId`, reporting a clear error (with the period searched) when it is not in that period.
  - `sherweb_customers_list`: path was already correct, but `search`/`page`/`pageSize` were silently ignored by the API — `GetCustomers` documents no query parameters. `search` is now applied client-side over `displayName`; the pagination parameters are gone.
  - `sherweb_customers_get`: there is no `GET /customers/{id}`; it now selects from the customers collection.
  - `sherweb_customers_accounts_receivable`: `/customers/{id}/accounts-receivable` → `/billing/receivable-charges?customerId=`, with the documented optional `date`.
  - `sherweb_subscriptions_list`: `/customers/{id}/subscriptions` → `/billing/subscriptions?customerId=`.
  - `sherweb_subscriptions_get`: Sherweb exposes no single-subscription endpoint, so this now reads `/billing/subscriptions/details?customerId=` and filters by `subscriptionId`.
  - `sherweb_subscriptions_change_quantity`: `POST /customers/{id}/subscriptions/{subId}/change-quantity` with a `{quantity}` body → `POST /billing/subscriptions/amendments?customerId=` with the documented `{subscriptionAmendmentParameters:[{subscriptionId,newQuantity}]}` batch body. Amendments are **asynchronous**: the tool previously presented the response as a completed change, and now returns the `subscriptionsAmendmentId` and `trackingId` with an explicit note that the change is not yet applied.
  - `sherweb_catalog_list_products`: `/catalog/products` → `/customer-catalogs/{customerId}`. Sherweb has no global catalog — offers and terms differ per customer — so `customerId` is now required, and `search` filters SKU and localized names client-side.
  - The MCP Apps subscription card's customer-name lookup used the same nonexistent `/customers/{id}` endpoint and now resolves from the customers collection.

- Multi-client Streamable HTTP: build a fresh `Server` + fresh
  `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per `/mcp` request (stateless —
  `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`) instead of sharing one stateful transport
  for the process lifetime. The shared, stateful transport
  (`sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID()`) rejected every client after the
  first with `-32600 "Invalid Request: Server already initialized"`, so behind
  the multi-user gateway only the first user since container start received
  tools — everyone else silently got zero tools until a restart. Request
  handlers were extracted into a `setupHandlers(server)` / `createFreshServer()`
  factory so both stdio and per-request HTTP servers share one definition. Each
  per-request server + transport is disposed on `res` close. stdio mode keeps a
  single long-lived server (it is inherently single-client). The gateway
  credential-header check and per-request `runWithCredentials`
  (AsyncLocalStorage) isolation are preserved. The per-request handler is fully
  guarded: on error it responds
  `500 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32603,...},"id":null}` when the
  response has not started and never rethrows, so one bad request cannot crash
  the container via a global `unhandledRejection` handler.
- `GET /health` (and new `GET /healthz`) are now shallow, unauthenticated
  liveness probes that always return `200 {"status":"ok"}`. Previously
  `/health` called `getCredentials()` and returned `503` when no
  process-wide credentials were set, which is always the case in gateway
  mode (`AUTH_MODE=gateway`) where credentials arrive per-request via
  headers. This caused the Azure Container Apps liveness probe to fail and
  SIGTERM-kill the container in a crash loop.
- CI `Test` job: added the missing `.eslintrc.json` so `npm run lint` can
  resolve a config (the reusable `mcp-server-ci.yml` workflow runs lint), and
  resolved the pre-existing `prefer-const` violations it surfaced.

### Added
- `src/health.ts` liveness-probe helpers (`isHealthPath`, `HEALTH_RESPONSE`)
  with unit tests in `src/health.test.ts`, giving the `Test` job a passing
  `vitest run` and covering the new `/health` / `/healthz` behavior.
